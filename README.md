#Haiku Maker
### We make haikus so that you don't have to.

This was my first solo bit of code that was not for  homework. At the time, I was frustrated in a bootcamp and trying to keep up. I took a break from homework to make this. I saw that I did understand, but that I was letting the assignment freeze my brain. Later, when I'd get frustrated again, I thought back to this. 

I like to return and add more phrases.
